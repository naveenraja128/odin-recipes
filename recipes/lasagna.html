    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a classic and beloved Italian dish that has become popular all over the world for its rich taste, comforting texture, and satisfying layers. It is traditionally made by stacking wide, flat pasta sheets with flavorful sauces, creamy cheese, and hearty fillings, then baking everything together until perfectly cooked. The result is a warm, filling meal that is both delicious and visually appealing.</p>
<p>One of the reasons lasagna is so special is its layered structure. Each layer adds its own flavor and texture, creating a perfect balance in every bite. The pasta sheets provide a soft yet firm base, while the sauce adds moisture and depth. Cheese, often mozzarella or ricotta, melts beautifully and binds all the ingredients together, giving lasagna its signature creamy taste. Many recipes also include a meat or vegetable filling, which makes the dish even more satisfying and nutritious.</p>
<p>Lasagna is often prepared for family gatherings, celebrations, or weekend meals because it can serve many people at once. It is a dish that brings people together, as it is usually shared at the dining table and enjoyed slowly. One of its best qualities is that it tastes even better the next day, making it a perfect meal for leftovers.</p>
<p>Another great thing about lasagna is its versatility. While traditional lasagna is made with meat sauce, there are many variations available today, including vegetarian, chicken, and even vegan versions. This flexibility allows people to customize the dish according to their taste preferences and dietary needs.</p>
<p>Overall, lasagna is more than just a meal—it is comfort food that represents warmth, tradition, and togetherness. Whether served at a special occasion or as a simple homemade dinner, lasagna remains one of the most loved pasta dishes in the world.</p>
